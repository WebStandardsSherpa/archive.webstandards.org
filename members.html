A freelance Web designer, writer and artist, Lance Arthur is the creator of
<a href="http://www.glassdog.com/" target="wasp">glassdog</a>. He has
appeared on panels for the last two years running at both Austin's
acclaimed South By Southwest and Miller-Freeman's
various touring Web-based circuses. He has not written a book.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An amalgam of witty  tales, Web design
tips, and bleeding-edge visual strategies, Glassdog is one of the Web's
most-awarded (and most imitated) sites, having won infinet's <a

Design of the Year</a> (1997) and David Siegel's <a
href="http://www.highfive.com/" target="wasp">HighFive</a>.
 <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lance currently resides in San Francisco,
California where he spends in excess of $15,000 per year to live in a
shoebox. Consequently, he must charge exhorbitant rates for his time which, for whatever reason, several
companies have agreed to. It's the Internet Economy, Stupid!

<p><strong>Roger Black</strong>,  President, <a href="http://www.iab.com/"
target="wasp">Interactive Bureau</a>
<br><br>Black is the creative and strategic head of the Interactive Bureau.
Long celebrated for his magazine and newspaper design, Black now is at the
forefront of Internet design, and personally leads many of Interactive
Bureau's  design teams. His best-selling book, <em>Websites That Work</em>
(Adobe, 1997) has just appeared in Japanese and Portuguese editions.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As president of Roger Black Incorporated,
he has rebuilt some of the world's most prestigious magazines and
newspapers over the past twenty-five years. His designs have changed the
face of Reader's Digest, Newsweek, Esquire, Rolling Stone, The New York
Times, Foreign Affairs, and scores of other publications on four continents.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interactive Bureau is the leading partner
of Media Design Network, the international design team Black has put
together. The group also includes the Font Bureau inBoston, and media
design studios in France, Spain, Mexico and Colombia.</p>

  <p><strong>Tomas Caspers</strong>, Freelance new media developer,
	Cologne, Germany <br><br>
Caspers (<a href="http://www.artware.de/" target="wasp">www.artware.de</a>)
	is a freelance Graphic Designer who, after a career in photography and
	print design, now specializes in the design and production of
multimedia
	projects and large-scale Websites for numerous international
clients in
	the automotive, food, chemical and software industry. <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his work Tomas puts emphasis on
usability
	issues and insists on good and Web-specific typography, which
unfortunately
	can hardly be put to work with the current crop of browsers and
their implementation
	of CSS and other technologies like PNG and Font embedding. <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tomas also co-authors articles on
topics like
	Web animation, colour issues and typography for industry publications.
	He thinks that if clients were able to spend more money on content
instead
	of debugging incompatibilities, the Web would be a better place. <br>

<em>HTML: The Definitive Guide</em> &nbsp;in the other, Rachel works to
shepherd Web sites through the rocky terrain between innovation and
frugality,  keeping a sharp eye out for the pitfalls of lousy standards
implementation. She has a background in writing, editing, visual
design, and communication, and has been working on Web sites in one
capacity or another for the last three years. Rachel tries to confine her
more vitriolic rants to her personal site, <a href="http://www.3-am.com/"

Interactive,</a> where he worked on high profile Websites including Namco
America, Midway Games, and Energizer Batteries.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joe thinks it's about time the Web paid
better attention to standards. To this end, and on a complete lark, he
joined the WaSP and penned the alpha version of the "Developer Standards
Baseline Proposal."  It has evolved into a sturdy product and is the WaSP's
<a href="mission.html">Mission Statement</a>. He is proud to be involved,
even cursorily, with something as worthwhile as the WaSP.</p>

traditional media work, has published works on story structure,
programming, and the Web.  As an applications designer and engineer, he's
developed and deployed software for use around the globe.

browser standards.

Martin's unique combination of analytic and artistic sensibilities provides

<p>
The Rotating Members Gallery is down, due to the tragic destruction of our database and backend during the summer of 2000. An <a href="supporters.html">Honor Roll</a> of sites supporting the WaSP is available, though it is incomplete and seriously outdated. We regret many things, and this is one of them.
</p>

<p>An outpouring of worldwide support has created a flood of new members and
supporters. You may view them in our rotating <a
href="/cgi-bin/wspreport.cgi">MEMBERS GALLERY.</a> Click to load new names.
Click again to load still more new names. It's fun. To add your name,
simply <a href="join.html">join the WaSP.</a>

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's also an <a
href="supporters.html">HONOR ROLL</a> of sites displaying our spiffy <a
href="banners.html">WaSP banners.</a>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

And a directory of WaSP <a href="ac.html">ACTION COMMITTEE</a> members is
being built Steven Noels at a separately maintained <a
