<P class="lead">
DOM de DOM DOM</P>

<P>
I know, fellow travelers. You're hearing the theme from Dragnet just like I
am.  It's time for The WaSP to take a look at the latest out of the mouths of
Microsoft and Netscape.</P>

<P>
It's actually been a good week for the Web.  On the 18th the <a
href=http://www.w3.org/>W3C</a> released the proposed recommendation for the
Document Object Model, Level-1.  This is an important paper that shapes how we
should be able to use the DOM in the future as the Web evolves.  The only
problem is, it isn't implemented and it sounds like Microsoft and Netscape are
hemming and hawing again trying to spin themselves a good line.</P>

  <P>
Too late, fellows.  The WaSP is here to counter your spin!</P>

 <P>
 A <a href=http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/14565.html
target="_new">story</a> in Wired News breaks the lips of the vendors on this
important development.  Take a look at it, then come back and let's see if you
see what I see when you read it.  Here's what Microsoft tells us first:</P>

<P>
"In [Internet Explorer] 5.0 we have support of the core DOM as listed in the
proposed recommendation," said Dave Wascha, Microsoft product manager for
platform marketing. "The core is the most important part." </P>

  
<P>
So they support  the core of the DOM-1 recommendation.  They say it's the most
important part.  When I look at the spec though, I see that the core is just
one part.  If they don't support the full DOM-1, are they really
supporting the DOM?  I don't think so.  You can't have just a little bit and
claim to have it all.  You either support it, or you don't.  Right now
Microsoft is telling us that they are "a little bit pregnant." </P>

 
<P>
 I just want to see Microsoft deliver a nice bouncing baby browser with all of
its fingers and toes in the right places.  Don't you?</P>

<P>
Netscape is also a little bit pregnant.  They say: "elements of the DOM will
certainly be supported."</P>
 

<P>
Well, that's certainly not a lie.  Elements of the DOM are <b>already</b>
supported.  DOM-1 is, after all, based on DOM-0 which is the Netscape3/IE3
DOM.</P>

<P>
Other than that, Netscape won't make a commitment.  The WaSP only wants to see them have a nice healthy pregnancy and deliver that browser with all the parts in place.</P>

<P>
We do get one shocking note from Microsoft this week:</P>

<P>
"If browser companies wrote strictly to support DOM, he said, some primary
features couldn't be added because they don't exist in the current standard. "</P>

<P>
Would someone please email Dave Wascha and point out the WaSP URL and mission
statement.  We're not against innovation.  I don't mind if Microsoft wants to
make a DOM that I can say "KEEN" about.  As long as they fully support the
standard, I don't care what they add to their implementation.  It's that
standard that I care about and you should too.</P>

<P>
The WaSP has another action item this week.  It's <B>"Be Kind to Netscape" Week</B> here at WSP headquarters.  They need help debugging their NGLayout Engine.  Go
<a href="ng.html">here</a> and give them a hand.  I know we all want to see
them release a fully standards compliant browser and if we can help,
well &#150; that's what it's all about.</P>

<P>
So listen up Netscape and Microsoft.  The WaSP will help you in anyway that it 
can.  But you've got to help us too.  It's time to commit to releasing a
browser that is fully standards compliant.  How about it?</P>

<P>
Keep the buzz!</P>
