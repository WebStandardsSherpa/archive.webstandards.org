<H3>NGlayout: Help Netscape become standards compliant</H3>

<P>
Netscape has yet to decide upon whether or not to include <B>NGlayout</B> in
their 5.0 release of Navigator.  NGlayout is their next generation
rendering engine that will (supposedly) be 100% compliant with CSS1 and
DOM level 1.  The time frame between the projected launch of NS5 and the
level of completion of NGlayout is the issue.</P>

<P>
<B>You can help.</B>  Download a version of
their NGlayout viewer from 

<A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~mozillabuilds/nglayout.html" target="_blank">members.tripod.com/~mozillabuilds/nglayout.html</A> (Win32 only at the moment).</P>

<P>
And then help out directly by following the instructions attached
below.  There is much more chance that Netscape will include NGlayout, and support of the standards, if the code is done. And for that to occur, they need our help.</P>

<P class="lead">
<B>Instructions</B></P>

<P>
We need help from people who do not code: </P>

<P>
<B>Report Crashes</B> <BR>
Download an NGLayout build and run the viewer, browsing popular web sites.
If (When) you crash the viewer, send a list of URLs that crash the viewer
to this newsgroup, or to rickg<img src="../images/at-600-white-10x10.gif" width="10" height="10" alt="at">netscape.com. Be sure to include the URL of
the site, the operating system you're on (Win95 or WinNT, etc.), and the
date of your build.</P>
 

<P>
<B>Report Layout Problems</B><BR>
Download an NGLayout build and run the viewer, browsing popular web sites.
If you run into problems with layout on a particular site, send mail to
the newsgroup with a description of what looks wrong, the URL of the site,
the OS you are running, and the date of your build. Expect to see quite a
bit of this sort of thing right now.</P>
 

<P>
<B>Test Cases and Suites</B>
Try to simplify problems you experience down to the most simple level.
Having a URL for a site with 50k of content is one thing, knowing that the
little snippet of HTML <b>"foo"</b> doesn't work right is quite another.
If you can give us a simpler example of your problem, do so. Also, please
run the viewer against test suites such as the CSS test suite at
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/" TARGET="_new">www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</A> and any other test suites for HTML and
DOM. Again, report problems to this group and someone will file in
bugzilla as necessary.</P>
. 

<P>
<B>Create Cool Content</B>
Download the viewer and create some whizzy, standards-based dynamic
content using our best-of-breed CSS support and the 100% standards-based
DOM. Surely there will be some good stuff we can work on in this category
along the lines of "how-to's" and whatnot that would be of interest to the
webmonkey audience. In turn, perhaps that audience would like to create
some of this whizzy content.</P>
 

<P>
We also need help from people who <B>do</B> code: </P>

<P>

<P>
<B>HTML 4.0 Geeks:</B><BR>

let us know what doesn't work. For HTML 4.0 forms issues, contact
<A HREF="mailto:karnaze%40netscape.com">karnaze<img src="../images/at-600-white-10x10.gif" width="10" height="10" alt="at">netscape.com</A> for info on how to help.</P>

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's a lot of other work that needs addressing. If you think you can help, let us know, and we'll try to point you in the right direction. Also, please download our latest source
code (best bet is via CVS, as we're updating the source <B>constantly</B>).</P>
