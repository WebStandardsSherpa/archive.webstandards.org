<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The article includes this comment:<BR>

<CITE>
Netscape has abandoned its earlier strategy of promoting proprietary
HTML extensions, and instead it's fervently latching onto open standards
maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium. Microsoft is doing the
same, though Netscape says its competitor sometimes violates the spirit
of the standards process by rolling out new features while submitting
wholly new proposals &#150; effectively creating proprietary extensions and
then foisting them on the standards committees.

own strategy for years.... </P>

standard HTML and some additional XML tags that are used to control the
behavior of the WASP. All .wasp files should be consistent with XML syntax. The

As Getting Wired has  frequently reported, the following of official
standards - despite all the fine  words from the major players - remains
more a pious hope than a reality. For  example, in implementing the
World-Wide Web Consortium's recommendations,  Microsoft's and Netscape's
browsers differ substantially. </P>

<P>
One major  category of users that suffers as a result is Web developers,
who have to plump  for one camp, work to common features or produce two
versions of everything.  Now, a group of them have set up the Web Standards
Project (at  www.webstandards.org/) with the aim of "fighting for standards
in our  browsers". Their goals are spelled out more fully in the press
release at  www.webstandards.org/WSP_release_MAIN.txt.</P>

<P>
When Web developers get  together for a high-profile cause such as this,
their own Web site will be  scrutinised closely. Fortunately, the Web
Standards Project  pages are exemplary. The HTML code comes complete with
DTD, &lt;META&gt; tags,  comments and plenty of cascading stylesheets
(CSS). Colour and design are simple  but effective. However, there is not
much content there yet.</P>

<P>
The Action  section (www.webstandards.org/action.html) has some nice
banners and links to  articles (www.webstandards.org/press.html). Mission
(www.webstandards.org/mission.html) gives more details on what the group is
hoping to achieve, while Members (www. webstandards.org/members.html) has
information on the people behind the movement. One name that may be
familiar to  Getting Wired readers is Glenn Davis, whose Project Cool
(www.projectcool.com/)  and DevSearch (www.devsearch. com/) sites have been
discussed before.</P>

<P>
By  far the richest part of the site is Resources (www.
webstandards.org/resources.html) which offers links to sites with similar
aims,  or information to help those grappling with conflicting browser
technologies.  For example, for one of the most important areas that needs
sorting out, CSS,  there is a link to a browser comparison table at
http:/style.webreview.com/mastergrid.html, and workarounds at
http:/css.nu/pointers/bugs.htm.</P>

<P>
And if you are wondering about the  latter's unusual .nu domain, it belongs
to the Polynesian island of Niue - visit  www.newnames.nu/visitniue/ for a
different kind of sightseeing.</P>
