<h1 class="vs0">Of Web Standards &amp; Patents</h1>

<p>WaSP urges all Web developers to read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-patent-policy-20010816/" target="wasp">Patent Policy draft</a> and <a href="mailto:www-patentpolicy-comment%40w3.org">mail comments</a> to the W3C before the 11 October cutoff date. Our own opinion follows.</p>

<h2 class="wacker">WaSP to W3C: Remember your Charter and Mission</h2>

<p> The WaSP would like to commend the W3C for taking the initiative to
 make explicit its policy regarding patents and Web technologies. Such
 policies have long been the norm in other industries, as well as in various 
 <a href="http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/MEMENTO/code.htm" target="wasp">other</a>
 <a href="http://www.jtc1tag.org/archive/2001/jt010150/jt010150.pdf" target="wasp" title="PDF file - requires viewer or plug-in.">standards</a>
 <a href="http://web.ansi.org/public/library/guides/ppguide.html" target="wasp">bodies</a>.</p> 

 <p>However, the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-patent-policy-20010816/" target="eljefe">policy</a> we have been shown is not explicit, but dangerous and counterproductive.</p>

<p>By opening the door to the adoption of patented technologies as Web
 standards, the W3C is turning its back on its own long-standing
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Points/" target="wasp">charter</a>.
 Among the stated goals of that mission are:</p>

<blockquote>"...by enabling new forms of human communication and opportunities
    to share knowledge...[to] make these benefits available to all
    people, whatever their hardware, software, network infrastructure,
    native language, culture, geographical location, or physical or
    mental ability..."<br /><br />
"...designing and promoting open (non-proprietary) computer
    languages and protocols that avoid the market fragmentation of the
    past..."
</blockquote>

<p> The W3C has never been a voice for the masses, and has never claimed
 to be. But this latest draft policy gives the impression of placing
no stock in the individuals and groups that made the Web
 possible in the first place. These individuals developed the Web and then
 made it free for all to share and build upon, creating tools, protocols and languages used by hundreds of millions worldwide.
</p>
 <p>By contrast, the Web of the future will be an even more corporate
affair&#8212;a long nightmare of so-called "defensive" software patents
giving rise to more and more litigious players.</p>
<p>Even if you reject as naive the idea that information
wants to be free, there's no reason the channels it flows through
shouldn't remain free. Instead, we see a Web fraying at the edges, as
the core stagnates and the rest is locked in bitter battles between
patent holders and independent developers.
</p>
 <p>Regardless of anyone's opinion of the propriety of issuing patents for
 software, it is clear that patents will continue to be
 applied for, and continue to be issued. The W3C should take a strong
 stand against the use or adoption of any patented technology as a Web
 standard, unless such patents are guaranteed to be and remain royalty-free, for use by all.</p>
<p>Such a stand will maintain the open nature of the Web, while
 allowing the participants to continue to innovate and the lawyers to 
 continue to protect their employers' assets. At the same time, it will 
 enable independent developers to continue expanding
 the variety of interoperable implementations without the threat of
 legal action. Remember the text of your own 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Full" target="wasp">Member Agreement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"[W3C] ...agree to grant and hereby grant to Member a non-exclusive
    <strong>royalty-free, irrevocable, right and license</strong> to use, reproduce,
    modify, translate, distribute, publicly display and publicly
    perform all computer software and documentation described in
    Section 7 (b) throughout the world..."</blockquote>

<p>We are not unreasonable, nor are we anti-corporate. We recognize that
some battles cannot be won, and that the interests of larger members of
a consortium often override those of everyone else. If the Reasonable
And Non-Discriminatory (RAND) clause cannot be dropped altogether, we
demand:</p>

<ol>
<li>that the policy clearly define such terms as "core", "essential",
   "non-essential" with respect to Recommendations, existing and under
   development, and to future plans for the Web's design and ongoing
   evolution</li>
<li>that caps be placed on any per-use fees that may be charged as
   a result of a RAND license</li>
<li>that the policy explicitly state that such technology will be
   licensed royalty-free, if possible, to any non-profit group or
   individual who wishes to provide an interoperable implementation of
   the technology in question</li>
</ol>

 <p>To do otherwise is to sell short the very audience your mission
 defines, by limiting the deployment of new Web technologies only to
 those with a clear profit motive (whether direct or indirect) and the
 extensive developmental and legal resources of major corporations.</p>

 <p>To do otherwise is to thereby stifle the very innovation, operability
 and universal access you so loudly proclaim as your core values.
</p>

 <p>We applaud the addition of patent disclosure requirements to the
 processes by which open standards are crafted. We are, however,
 extremely curious as to what remedies the W3C policy offers in the
 case of a breach of good faith by one of its Members.</p>
<p> As the policy stands, there are none, and we are to take it on faith that not only
 will Members disclose patents and applications they may not have had
 a hand in submitting, but if they do not, the Working Group will be
 disbanded and the technology abandoned in its current form.</p>
<p> This unacceptably weak link in the policy essentially allows any
 Member to sabotage any W3C technology simply by filing for a patent
 application.</p> 

 <p>We suggest that any Member found in violation of the disclosure
 clauses of the policy be barred from participation in or
 communication with the other Members of the various W3C Working
 Groups for a period of no less than two years. This should extend not only to the individual representative, but to all representatives of any Member determined to be in bad faith, whether currently involved in Working Groups or not.</p>

 <p>Such violators should also be required to abandon all claims to RAND
 licensing for the technology in question, and instead make the
 technology royalty-free as a demonstration of their commitment to
 open standards and fair and open cooperation.</p>

<p>We thank you for opening this process up to public comment, and for
 extending the comment period (however briefly) so that we could actually read the
 proposed policy and reply. Let's make sure that the same spirit of
 openness and receptivity to the audience you claim to serve is
 not threatened again.</p>

<p> We understand that the "inherently difficult twists and turns of some
 of the patent licensing language" may have led us into error with
 respect to our interpretation of the policy. If so, please either do
 your best to explain the twists or to remove them altogether. We are counting on W3C to continue "leading the Web to its full potential."&#8212;The WaSP</p>
