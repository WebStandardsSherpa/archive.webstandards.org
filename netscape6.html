<h2>
WEB STANDARDS PROJECT APPLAUDS NETSCAPE 6.0 AS MILESTONE TOWARD A
STANDARDS-BASED WEB</h2>  

<p><a href="../www.webstandards.org/index.html" title="Back to The Web Standards Project's home page.">The Web Standards Project (WaSP)</a> today applauded Netscape for
producing the most standards-compliant browser the Web has yet
seen. Based on the open source Mozilla project, Netscape 6
exceeds all previous browsers, including Netscape&#146;s own, in the
scope of its support for W3C and other Web standards. The new
Netscape browser supports HTML 4, XML 1.0, CSS-1, DOM Level 1,
and ECMAScript (the standard successor to Netscape&#146;s JavaScript),
as well as key parts of CSS-2.</p>

<p>"Recently, other browsers have delivered solid support for
several key Web standards, but none goes as far as Netscape has
now gone," said Web Standards Project group leader Jeffrey
Zeldman. "When The Web Standards Project was formed, we <a href="mission.html" title="The WaSP Mission Statement">asked</a>
browser makers to support five key Web standards. Netscape is the
first to do exactly what we asked."</p>

<p>At the same time, the WaSP cautioned that Netscape&#146;s achievement
alone will not make the Web safe for standards. "This can only
work if all browser manufacturers fully support the same
standards," Zeldman said. "Netscape's achievement is a milestone,
but the battle for Web standards is not over."</p>

<p>"It's time for developers and content folks to start using these
standards in their own work," said B.K. DeLong of the WaSP
steering committee. "Browser makers can't fix sites built with
non-standard code. Designers and developers need to stop
authoring  proprietary code and support Web standards by actually
using them in their sites. This will also enable those using
non-traditional browsers to have sites worth viewing."</p>

<p>Steve Champeon of the WaSP steering committee added:  "We
congratulate Netscape on leveraging the power of open source to
raise the bar on standards support, showing the world that it can
be done. We see this as a cause for celebration; but also for
caution."</p>

<p>Champeon pointed out that the new browser is not perfect. "There
are some bugs. We hope Netscape can fix them with help from the
Mozilla Project, whose open source browser is relatively free of
the real-world pressure that drove the release of Netscape 6."
The WaSP looks forward to Netscape&#146;s taking the browser to the
next level.</p>

<p>The Web Standards Project is a grassroots coalition of Web
developers and users fighting for standards in our browsers. More
