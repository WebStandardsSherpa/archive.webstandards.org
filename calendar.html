<p>Many past conferences that should be on this page were lost during "the troubles" of Summer 2000. About a year's worth of past conferences are missing. On the other hand, who cares about past conferences? Here's what's coming up:</p>

<h2>Coming Up</h2>

<p>
<strong><a HREF="http://builderlive.devx.com/2000/default.asp" target="wasp" title="'The conference built by web professionals for web professionals.'">CNET Builder.com, New Orleans</a></strong>, 6-10 December 2000<br>

Also: Zeldman on <a href="http://builderlive.devx.com/2000/keynotes.asp#Zeldman" target="wasp" title="Usability experts see the Web falling apart because the designers prefer intros to information. Graphic artists complain they're being handcuffed while trying to develop a visual vocabulary for an emerging medium. And developers fret that the Web will go kablooey anyway, due to browser incompatibilities and lack of full support for Web standards. Here's the good news: we'll show you why we are closer than we realize to a Web that is standards compliant, visually beautiful, and accessible to all.">Artistry, Accessibility, and Standards: The Good News</a>.

<STRONG>Web Standards: How Much Are Browser Incompatibilities Costing You?</STRONG><BR>
Tuesday December 8, 11:15 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.<BR>
If you could shave 20-25 percent off the cost of your Web projects, would
it be worth the effort to do so? The lack of standards support in Web
browsers is costing everyone money and is fragmenting the Web as a whole.
Come hear what top Web developers, browser makers and other industry
insiders have to say about the current problems with standards, and discuss
the prospects for fixing them.

<BR>16 September 1998</B><BR>

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"If you could shave 25% to 50% off the cost of web development, would it be
worth the effort?  The lack of standards support in web browsers is costing
everyone money and is causing fragmentation of the web as a whole.  Come
hear what three top web development authorities from the three top web
development sites have to say about this and learn about The Web Standards
Project,  a group of web developers who've said 'enough is enough' and are
working to improve standards support beyond the lip service that the big
two currently provide."</P>
