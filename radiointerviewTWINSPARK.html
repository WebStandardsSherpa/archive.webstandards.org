<p>INTERVIEWER:</p>

<p>Webdesigners have had enough, everytime a new browser hits the
market they have to check their websites for new problems, because
every browser is different and they don't show sites the same way.</p>

<p>In the US a group of designers has taken the initiative to start
the Web Standards Project, they believe that every browser should show
a website the same way.</p>

<p>How is this problem possible, aren't there any standards?</p>



<p>MARK:</p>

<p>The problem is that the standards are not completely integrated in
the browsers.</p>



<p>INTERVIEWER:</p>

<p>So the browser manufacturers are making up their own gadgets?</p>



<p>MARK:</p>

<p>That's one thing for sure, but that isn't really the biggest
problem. The problem is that they do not integrate the standard that is
already accepted!</p>



<p>INTERVIEWER:</p>

<p>But isn't it in their own interest to make sure the browser
supports the complete standard?</p>



<p>MARK:</p>

<p>Well, yes that's what I would say. That's why I do not understand
why those companies do not integrate the standard.</p>



<p>INTERVIEWER:</p>

<p>Are the manufacturers trying to make eachothers life impossible?</p>



<p>MARK:</p>

<p>I'm sure there's a lot of politics and strategy involved, but
that's exactly why there is an independent standards organization.</p>



<p>INTERVIEWER:</p>

<p>What are the consequences for you as a webdesigner?</p>



<p>MARK:</p>

<p>First of all it means a lot of testing on all the different
browsers once you (think you) finished the site. For that you need
several different machines because for instance Explorer 4.0 can not
work alongside Explorer 3.0 on the same machine. And there is always
the MAC and the PC.</p>



<p>It always costs a lot of extra time which you would rather invest
in more productive ways. This whole issue withholds designers from
better and more efficient design. A designer is often more busy trying
to find &quot;workarounds&quot;, because it is not possible to fully
use the complete standard for every browser.</p>

<p>You never exactly now beforehand what a browser will do with a
certain page until you have tested it.</p>



<p>The biggest problem is that designers are getting used to working
around these &quot;browser-flaws&quot;, it has become a given fact you
have to live with. That is why it is good someone is at least trying to
take a stand again!</p>



<p>INTERVIEWER:</p>

<p>Will there ever come an end to the development of the HTML standard
or internet standards in general?</p>



<p>MARK:</p>

<p>As long as the internet is still user-unfriendly (as any user can
experience, be it speed or design), there is a lot of work to do for
designers, this includes a lot of good interaction design. Crucial for
being able to make good design are the  tools that help deliver the
design to the user, and these tools need standards!</p>

<p>In my opinion development will never stop because we will keep on
learning and design will always get better (or more efficient), and
therefor the standards will have to continue to evolve.</p>



<p>Or to look at it in another way, as long as I can not leave my
grandmother alone on the net without getting lost, design and standards
will need to improve.</p>
