<DIV TITLE="Introduction">
 <H2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></H2>

 <p>
  The uneven deployment of
  <ACRONYM TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1">CSS1</ACRONYM>
  in major Web browsers over the last two years has caused Web authors
  great frustration and expense, and has won

  <ACRONYM TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</ACRONYM> an
  undeservedly obscure and difficult reputation. As unfortunate as
  this failure has been for
  <acronym title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> in the
  recent past, the implications for
  <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> in the
  near future are even more disturbing: lacking adequately mature
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>
  implementations,
  <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> will
  generally be converted first to non-reusable <acronym
  title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> for display. This
  will retard the deployment of distributed
  <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>
  applications, as the richest data will tend to remain on servers or
  decay quickly on clients.
 </p>

 <p>
  Implementation of
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2">CSS2</acronym> in

  the major browsers may show similar problems. Early implementations
  of some parts of
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2">CSS2</acronym>
  have been buggy. If the browsers do not interpret
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2">CSS2</acronym>
  exactly as described by the spec, many of the most powerful features
  of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2">CSS2</acronym>
  may become unusable because of new browsers that interpret those
  features incorrectly, as has already happened with parts of <acronym
  title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1">CSS1</acronym>. Old browsers
  that do not follow the error-handling guidelines set forth by
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1">CSS1</acronym> have
  already caused enough damage to
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2">CSS2</acronym>.
  Many features of <acronym
  title="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2">CSS2</acronym> are now
  unusable without browser-sniffing (that is, sending different
  stylesheets to different browsers).
 </p>

 <p>
  The <acronym title="Web Standards Project">WSP</acronym>
  is determined to prevent these problems from repeating
  themselves.  With that goal in mind, these documents are
  produced by the <a href="members.html">members</a> of the <A
  HREF="../../www.webstandards.org/index.html">Web Standards Project</A>
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> <a
  href="../../www.webstandards.org/ac.html#technical">Action
  Committee</a>, otherwise known as the
  <cite><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> Samurai</cite>.
  The Samurai hope to improve browser implementations of <acronym
  title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> by finding and
  reporting on bugs in existing implementations and by encouraging
  browser makers to fix bugs and to fully support the <acronym
  title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> recommendations.

<DIV ID="top10" TITLE="CSS standards compliance reviews">
 <H2><a name="The_Top_10_Lists">CSS standards compliance reviews</a></H2>

 <P>
  As a matter of policy, the
  <ACRONYM title="Web Standards Project">WSP</ACRONYM>
  provides thorough coverage of and
  feedback on interim releases of major browsers'
  <ACRONYM title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</ACRONYM> implementations.
  To date, we have published the following reviews:
 </P>

 <ul>
  <li><a href="macie/index.html">Microsoft Macintosh Internet Explorer's Top 10 CSS Problems</a> (September 1999)</li> 
  <li><a href="opera/index.html">Opera's Top 10 CSS Problems</a> (February 1999)</li>
  <li><a href="winie/index.html">Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer's Top 10 CSS Problems</a> (November 1998)</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  <a name="nn4note"><em>Note</em></a>: We do not plan on reviewing any
  Netscape browsers until Communicator 5.0 begins to approach its
  final form. Netscape does not claim that Communicator 4.0 or 4.5 is
  <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> compliant.
  Trying to list the important bugs would be an exercise in writing
  long documents, one we do not have the patience to do. Running
  Netscape 4.x through the tests we use to document bugs in Opera and
  Microsoft Internet Explorer will provide a clear demonstration of
  Netscape's current shortcomings to anyone who doubts them. Of about
  40 test pages in our first two reviews, there are only two that
  <em>don't</em> demonstrate problems in Netscape Communicator <!--
  i.e., opera/specificitydemo1, opera/linkdemo1 --> (and we weren't
  even <em>looking</em> for bugs in Netscape Communicator when we
  wrote those tests). However, we expect to be able to hold Netscape
  Communicator 5.0 to the same standards (no pun intended) as the
  other two browsers.
