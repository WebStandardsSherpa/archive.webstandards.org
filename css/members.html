<P>You may note that many of us are involved in one way or another with
the various companies whose browsers we review. It would be sensible,
therefore, to question the impartiality of the Samurai.  However, you may
rest assured that we make every attempt to review each browser fairly,
without bias in favour or against the companies or organisations we help
or by which we are paid. In September 1999, we decided that these
involvements do not threaten our impartiality as a group and therefore
that there is no need for any member to leave the Samurai because of a
connection to a company.</P>

<P>Our word may not be enough for some people, so we have decided to
list, below, with which developers we are each involved. Since we have
members working for all the major UA developers as well as for the
W3C's CSS working group and some tool developers, the net result is
that for each member potentially biased in one direction, there is
another potentially biased in the other.</P>

<p>Remember: The most important issue to us is not the success of the
companies we are involved with. It is the full and bug-free
implementation of the CSS standards.</p>

 <p>
  David is an undergraduate at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard
  University</a>, in Cambridge, MA.  He has been working on his
  own web pages (mainly lists of links) since 1994, and began
  to become interested in using CSS for the design of his site
  on <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dbaron/sat/">weather
  satellite images</a>.  However, his interest in CSS was
  strengthened by stumbling across an announcement of the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/">W3C Core Styles</a> and
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">CSS1 Test Suite</a>.
  He began using the Core Styles on most of his web pages, and was
  quickly drawn into the promising world of CSS.
 </p>

 <p>
  He now tries to improve implementations of CSS by submitting many
  bug reports to all the major browser vendors.  He maintains
  <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dbaron/css/">CSS
  pages</a> showing results of running browsers through CSS1 Test
  Suite, as well as some of his own CSS tests.  In an attempt
  to help perfect CSS itself, he is a frequent poster to the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists.html#www-style">www-style</a> list.

  He spent last summer (1999) as a (paid) intern at Netscape.

<DIV ID="braden" TITLE="Braden McDaniel">
 <H2><a name="Braden_McDaniel" href="http://www.endoframe.com/">Braden McDaniel</a></H2>

 <p>
  Braden is a Computer Science graduate student at the <a
  href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/">University of Miami</a>, in Miami,
  FL, with an interest in hypermedia technologies. He is a frequent
  poster on <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists.html#www-style">www-style</a> and
  on <a
  href="news:comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets">c.i.w.a.s</a>.
  He maintains web pages on CSS and VRML, and is a frequent poster to
  the Mozilla newsgroups.

<DIV ID="eric" TITLE="Eric Meyer">
 <H2><a name="Eric_Meyer" href="http://www.cwru.edu/home/eam3.html">Eric Meyer</a></H2>

 <p>
  Eric is the Hypermedia Systems Manager at <A
  HREF="http://www.cwru.edu/"> Case Western Reserve University</A> in
  Cleveland, Ohio. This makes him responsible for the main university
  Web server, as well as team leader for a number of new-technology
  projects such as the <A HREF="http://ech.cwru.edu/">Encyclopedia of
  Cleveland History</A>.
 </p>

 <p>
  In the course of creating various and sundry Web pages, Eric noticed
  that his attempts to use CSS1 weren't quite as successful as he felt
  they ought to be. His CSS looked correct, but browsers just weren't
  displaying it as they should. Upon further investigation, he found
  that there was very little information regarding CSS1 support
  available on the Web, save for fellow Samurai <A
  HREF="#Braden_McDaniel">Braden McDaniel</A>'s page concerning
  support in IE3 for Win95. Since Eric is an unrepentant Macintosh
  user, this wasn't much help to him, but it did inspire him to create
  a similar page concerning Macintosh browser support of CSS1.
 </p>

 <p>
  This led Eric on to an entire body of work concerning CSS and CSS
  support. He is now an invited expert to the W3C CSS Working Group
  and coordinator of the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">CSS1 Test Suite</a> at the
  W3C. He is also the editor of the <a
  href="http://style.webreview.com/">Style Sheets Reference Guide</a>
  and author of many <a
  href="http://www.cwru.edu/dms/homes/eam3/pubs.html">articles</a>
  about CSS.
 </p>

 <p>
  He is currently a beta tester for Microsoft's Internet Explorer
  browser, and is also 'a closet Opera-lover'.
