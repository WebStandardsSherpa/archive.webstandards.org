<H2>Example 1</H2>

<P>In the following paragraph, the first line should be green, the rest should be black.</P>

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful golden cat called Maximus. His
one mission in life was to rest. He would wake up in the morning,
ready to sleep all the way through the day. Then he would wake up at
night, and have a nice lie in till the next morning. He thought his
life could never have been better, and indeed, it couldn't. He lived
happily ever after.
</P>
</DIV>

<P>This is what it <em>should</em> have looked like (but wrapping in different places):

happily ever after.

<H2>Example 2</H2>

<P>In the following paragraph, the first character should be three times bigger than the rest.</P>

Once upon a time, there was a slick black cat called Charlie.  His one
mission in life was to eat. He would wake up in the morning, and
immediately look to see what he could feast on. He ate chicken, and he
ate mouse. He ate anything he could get his teeth into. He thought his
life could never have been better, and indeed, it couldn't. He lived
happily ever after.
