<DIV ID="introduction" TITLE="Introduction">
 <H2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></H2>
 <P>
  Microsoft led the way in implementing Cascading Style Sheets,
  first in Internet Explorer&nbsp;3.0, then improving
  that support significantly in Internet Explorer&nbsp;4.0. While Microsoft's implementation of <ACRONYM TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1">CSS1</ACRONYM> has thus far always been the best available, it has also failed in completeness and quality to offer a viable alternative to HTML-based layout and formatting techniques. In fact, several of the most critical features of CSS1 remain 
  either incorrectly implemented, implemented for only an undocumented selection of 
  eligible HTML elements, or entirely neglected in Internet Explorer. This document presents the most glaring 
  of these problems.
 </P>
 <P>The uneven deployment of <ACRONYM 
  TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1">CSS1</ACRONYM> in major 
  Web browsers over the last two years has caused Web authors great 
  frustration and expense, and won <ACRONYM>CSS</ACRONYM> an undeservedly obscure and difficult reputation. As unfortunate as this failure has been for HTML in the recent past, the implications for XML in the near future are even more disturbing: lacking adequately mature CSS implementations, XML will generally be converted first to nonreusable HTML for display. This will retard the deployment of distributed XML applications, as the richest data will tend to remain on servers or decay quickly on clients. 

</p><p>Now that Netscape and Opera promise to release competitive CSS1 implementations in the near future, the WaSP calls upon Microsoft to finish the work it began, letting Web designers, authors, application developers, and users build upon a single, robust foundation for Web presentation: <ACRONYM>CSS1</ACRONYM>.

 <DIV ID="boxModel" TITLE="Make the box model work">
  <H3><a name="The_box_model">1. The box model</a></H3>
      <P> Of all the problems CSS authors face, most vexing by far is the incomplete 
        implementation of the box model. The box model governs the margin, padding, 
        and border properties of elements, and is essential for achieving alignments, 
        hierarchies, rhythms, and other important visual relationships. Equally important is support for the allied <CODE>width</CODE> and 
   <CODE>height</CODE> properties for all elements with
   <CODE>block</CODE> display. It will 
        require complete and quirk-free support for the box model on all elements 
        in order to retire tedious workarounds like tables for layout, or the 
        pernicious replacement of structurally appropriate elements with the generic 
        <code>DIV</code> merely to avoid box-model implementation snares. </p>
      <p>This document, for instance, contains a <code>DIV</code> whose <code>ID</code> 
        is "body". It is entirely redundant with the <code>BODY</code> element, 
        yet made expedient because the box model is not supported on the <code>BODY</code> 
        element in IE. Such quirks encourage spurious, browser-specific markup 
        and stylesheet tricks, and are an impediment 
        to the widespread adoption of CSS1.</p>

  <P>
   Though technically part of the box model described above, incorrect support for 
   the <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>clear</CODE> properties is important 
   enough to merit a separate point. Most pages on the Web rely on tables 
   for their visual structure, confusing their logical structure beyond repair. <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>clear</CODE> are the CSS alternatives to HTML tables for placing elements side-by-side. By retiring the need for presentational tables in HTML, correct support for <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>clear</CODE> can make richly-formatted Web documents dramatically faster, simpler, more reusable, and more accessible.

 <DIV ID="errorHandling" TITLE="Incorrect Error Handling">
  <H3><a name="Incorrect_Error_Handling">3. Error handling</a></H3>
  <P>
   The error-handling in IE's CSS parser is often in error.
   The CSS1 specification explains very clearly how things should be
   handled (i.e., what to ignore), but IE does not follow this part of
   the standard. This causes documents designed
   for levels of the CSS specification not yet supported by the browser to
   render incorrectly.

 <DIV ID="tableGack" TITLE="Inheritance breakdown within tables">
  <H3><a name="Inheritance_breakdown_within_tables">4. Inheritance within tables</a></H3>
      <P> Another bug engineered into IE is that style inheritance (whereby container 
        objects pass their style on to their children) breaks down upon entering 
        a table element. </P>
      <P> For example, if a rule applied to the <code>BODY</code> element declares 
        a <code>small</code> font size, then all text within tables will look 
        oddly large. Redundant selectors and spurious markup are required to repair 
        the failure of inheritance. Unable to use CSS1's layout facilities, authors 
        turn to HTML tables instead, where the rest of CSS1 breaks down into still 
        more redundant hackery, no more elegant than the old single-pixel-GIFs 
        and overstuffed <code>FONT</code> tags. </P>
  <P>
   The reason given for this behavior is to maintain "bugwards compatibility" 
   with a similar quirk introduced by Netscape Navigator, in its initial implementation
   of HTML tables. This perpetuates the legacy of broken document parsing and obligates authors to
   compensate in their work. We believe authors would much rather see this historical curiosity
   dropped, in favor of a more consistent CSS system.
  </P>
      <P> A better way to fix this would be to provide it as an option such 
        as &quot;Enable Legacy Table Parsing,&quot; rather than compel it as a 
        default. </P>

      <P> IE's support for<CODE> background-repeat</CODE> and <CODE>background-position</CODE>, 
        is incomplete. Explorer repeats tiled background images down and 
        to the right, no matter where the initial image is positioned. If an author 
        positions an image in the center of an element and then sets it to repeat, 
        it will fill only the lower right corner of the element. The specification, 
        however, requires that the image be tiled in all four directions: up, 
        down, right, and left. A similar problem occurs with <CODE>repeat-x</CODE> 
        and <CODE>repeat-y</CODE>, which should repeat in both directions either 
        horizontally or vertically. </P>

 <DIV ID="display" TITLE="Display: block, inline, list-item, and none everywhere">
  <H3><a name="Displayprops">1. Display properties</a></H3>
  <P>

   When this was first written, IE did not support the <code>display</code> 
        property, apart from the <code>none</code> value. 
   We are happy to note that Microsoft appears to have addressed this in a 5.0b release,
   supporting both <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code>.
   Support for <code>list-item</code> is still missing, however. </p><p>This document, for instance, 
   has manually numbered <code>H3</code> elements. If the list-item display type were supported for <code>H3</code>, 
   the UA might generate the numbering as with any other list, resetting the counter at each occurrence of <code>H2</code>.</p><p>
   CSS2 introduces a number
   of new values for the display property; and as nice as it would be to
   see those implemented, we believe designers would rather see them
   postponed in favor of complete support for
   the CSS1 values.

 <DIV ID="altStyle" TITLE="Alternate stylesheet UI">

  <H3><a name="Alternate_stylesheet_UI">3. Alternate stylesheet UI</a></H3>
  <P>
   CSS1 provides for authors to associate multiple stylesheets with a
   document, allowing users to choose the most appropriate or pleasing.
  </P>

  <P>
   For example, a designer could create a default "public" stylesheet for a body of documents, a second sheet suitable for intra-organizational or -departmental access to the same documents, and a third suitable for users who are visually impaired (using high-contrast colors, for instance). The mechanism is extensible to include transparent application of media-specific stylesheets: one for print, one for WebTV, another for hand-held device browsers - all without content redundancy. This document, for instance, written in HTML 4.0 Strict, is associated with three distinct stylesheets. Unfortunately, due to lack of support for this CSS1 feature, you are unlikely to have any choice but the default.
  </P>

      <P> Among the primary design goals of CSS is to restore balance among the 
        responsibilities the author, the user, and the user agent (UA; i.e., the 
        browser) must share when negotiating the presentation of Web content under 
        varying conditions. These goals require the exposure of alternate author 
        style sheets, the ability to turn off author stylesheets conveniently 
        per document, the ability to apply user stylesheets, and the exposure 
        of a UA default stylesheet for each media type. Internet Explorer supports 
        one of these requirements - user stylesheets - but it is hidden in a dialog 
        available from a dialog, not terribly usable on a per-document basis. 
      </P>
     <P>By not implementing a more extensive user interface for alternate and user CSS, Microsoft turns CSS from a language designed to balance user and author needs into a fundamentally user-hostile instrument. With users unable to interact with author CSS easily, authors are entertained not only with the promise of reckless authority in all matters of style, but with the temptation to create documents that are meaningless with any stylesheets other than their own.
      </P>
  <P class=note>
   <strong>Note.</strong> It is possible to <em>simulate</em> support for alternate stylesheets in the Windows version of IE4, using a 'plugin' developed by Microsoft engineer
   <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/4708/">Chris Wilson</A>.
   This plugin is available from <CODE><A
   HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/4708/ssselect.zip">http://www.geocities.com/Area51/4708/ssselect.zip</A></CODE>.
   A plugin doesn't 
        fix the problem, however; it only provides a workaround. This functionality 
        should be available out-of-the-box, so all users can benefit from this 
        feature, and authors may begin to expect support for the same. </P>

   Vertical alignment of elements is an essential layout facility provided for in CSS1. In fact,
   the lack of support for this feature in CSS implementations is a major reason authors continue to rely on tables to style
   their pages. Explorer supports
   the superscript and subscript values of this property (albeit quirkily:
   the font-size should not change when this value is applied).
