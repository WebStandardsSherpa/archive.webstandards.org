<H1>Problems setting <code>width</code> on Tables</H1>

<P>Opera's support for the <code>width</code> property has two serious
problems. The first is that width is completely unsupported on
<code>TABLE</code> elements.</P>

<P>Below is a table that has been set to have an explicit width of
400px. If you have images enabled, you will see a ruler has been
placed to allow you to measure the size of the table. The ruler is in
pixels.</P>
