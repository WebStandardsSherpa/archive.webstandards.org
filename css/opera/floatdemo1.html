<H1>Demonstration of Line Breaking Around Floating Elements</H1>

<DIV>
 Opera doesn't properly support one of the simplest uses of floating
 elements, floating an image into the margin in the middle of a paragraph.
 Suppose I were writing about a physics problem involving a bunch of
 pulleys.  This is known as an Atwood's Machine.  So say there is a mass
 m<SUB>3</SUB> supported by a system of two pulleys.  The pulley closest
 to the mass is fixed by a rope to the ceiling, so it can only rotate.
 It has inertia I<SUB>2</SUB>.  The other pulley is free to move up and
 down, and it is being held up on its two ends by a rope that is connected
 on one end to the first pulley and on the other end to the ceiling.
 This is getting complicated, isn't it?  So wouldn't I want to include
 a figure, right <em>here</em><DIV CLASS="marg"><IMG SRC="pulleys.gif"
 ALT="An Atwood's Machine"><BR>Figure 1: An Atwood's Machine</DIV> in
 the text, contained in a <code>DIV</code> that is floated to the right,
 so I can give it a caption?  This makes it much easier to understand
 the problem.  But Opera doesn't display this correctly.  It puts a
 line break in the middle of the text where the figure is floated.
 This should <em>not</em> happen.  It is a serious bug, since it is in
 one of the most basic uses of floating elements.
</DIV>
