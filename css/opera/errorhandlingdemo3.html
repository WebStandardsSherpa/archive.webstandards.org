<H1><A NAME="top">Incorrect Error Handling</A></H1>

<P>This page has the following stylesheet:</P>
<PRE>
color:maroon P.two {color: red; }
</PRE>

<P CLASS="two">This text, which has class two, should not be red.</P>

<P>
 When Opera sees <code>:maroon</code>, it should parse maroon as
 a pseudo-class / pseudo-element.  Since the only pseudos Opera knows
 are <code>:link</code>, <code>:visited</code>, <code>:active</code>,
 <code>:first-line</code>, and <code>:first-letter</code>, the entire
 selector should be ignored.  Why is this a problem?  Opera is using
 a strange heuristic to determine whether something before a selector
 was actually code that should have been within a block, but wasn't.
 If opera thinks that that was code that should have been in a block,
 it ignores it and parses the rest of the selector.  However, this
 heuristic, as do most workarounds of this type, has serious bugs (see
 <A HREF="errorhandlingdemo2a.html">the second example</A>).  The
 entire selector should be ignored because of the standard rules for
 parsing:  if error selection varies across browsers, the web will become
 a big mess, because each browser will be &quot;forgiving&quot; in
 different ways.
