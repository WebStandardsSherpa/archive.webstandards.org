<H1>Demonstration of Floating Elements Covering Text</H1>

<P>
 Opera doesn't properly support one of the simplest uses of floating
 elements, floating an image into the margin in the middle of a paragraph.
 Suppose I were writing about a physics problem involving a bunch of
 pulleys.  This is known as an Atwood's Machine.  So say there is a mass
 m<SUB>3</SUB> supported by a system of two pulleys.  The pulley closest
 to the mass is fixed by a rope to the ceiling, so it can only rotate.
 It has inertia I<SUB>2</SUB>.  The other pulley is free to move up and
 down, and it is being held up on its two ends by a rope that is connected
 on one end to the first pulley and on the other end to the ceiling.
 This is getting complicated, isn't it?  So wouldn't I want to include
 a figure, right <em>here</em><IMG CLASS="marg" SRC="pulleys.gif"
 ALT="An Atwood's Machine"> in the text?  This makes it much easier
 to understand the problem.  But Opera doesn't display this correctly.
 It hides text under the floating image.  This should <em>not</em> happen.
 It is a serious bug, since it is in one of the most basic uses of
 floating elements.
