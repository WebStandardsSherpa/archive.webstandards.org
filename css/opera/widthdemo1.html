<H1>Opera's Internal Table Width Algorithm</H1>

<P>Opera has an internal table width algorithm that is supposed to make
the table fit its contents. It is this algorithm that, in version 3.50,
<A HREF="widthdemo4.html">overrides the CSS-set width</A>.  However,
this algorithm still fails when there is margin on the
<code>TABLE</code>, as the algorithm is applied <em>before</em> taking
the margin into account!  It would also have problems with padding, except
that in Opera 3.51, padding on tables does not work at all.</P>

<H3>Example 1 - Margin</H3>

<P>The following table has a 50px margin set using CSS. It should be
completely visible <em>within</em> the viewport.</P>

<TABLE class="margin" border=1><TR><TD>This is a table, with a 50px
margin. This is a table, with a 50px margin. This is a table, with a
50px margin. This is a table, with a 50px margin. This is a table,
with a 50px margin. This is a table, with a 50px margin. This is a
table, with a 50px margin. This is a table, with a 50px margin. This
is a table, with a 50px margin. This is a table, with a 50px margin.
This is a table, with a 50px margin. </TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Example 2 - Padding</H3>

<P>The following table has 50px padding set using CSS.  Opera 3.51 does
not support padding on tables.  (In Opera 3.50, the padding appears on
the top and left sides, but not the bottom and right, and this causes
the same problem seen in Example 1.)  In Opera 3.51, the padding does
<em>nothing</em>, so the problem doesn't really show up.</P>

<TABLE class="padding" border=1><TR><TD>This is a table, with a 50px
padding. This is a table, with a 50px padding. This is a table, with a
50px padding. This is a table, with a 50px padding. This is a table,
with a 50px padding. This is a table, with a 50px padding. This is a
table, with a 50px padding. This is a table, with a 50px padding. This
is a table, with a 50px padding. This is a table, with a 50px padding.
This is a table, with a 50px padding. </TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Example 3 - Margin and Padding</H3>

<P>The following table has both 50px padding and 50px margin set using
CSS. It should also be completely visible <em>within</em> the
viewport.</P>

<TABLE class="margin padding" border=1><TR><TD>This is a table, with a
50px padding and 50px margin. This is a table, with a 50px padding and
50px margin. This is a table, with a 50px padding and 50px margin. This
