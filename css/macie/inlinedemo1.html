<H1>Margins and Padding on Inline Elements</H1>

<H2>1. Margin on Inline Elements</H2>

<p class="testmargin">This is a normal testing paragraph, for reference.</p>

<p class="testmargin">This is a normal testing paragraph, for reference.</p>

<P class="testmargin"><span>This is an inline box with a 3em margin.
The margin should not have any effects on the top and bottom, since line
spacing is determined by <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>,
and <code>vertical-align</code>.  On the sides, it should cause a gray
space before and after the inline box, which ends after this sentence.
Instead of doing this, MacIE applies the margins for the inline box to
the block level element in which the inline box is contained.  The top
margins are only applied when the inline box begins the block box and
the side margins are only applied when the inline box begins every line
of the block box.  The bottom margins seem to be applied only when the
inline element ends the block box.</span></p>

<P class="testmargin">When the inline box does not begin the block box,
different things happen.  <span>While the behavior should be the same,
a simple gray space before and after the box, MacIE indents the inline
box at the beginning and end of every line on which it is continued (but
not the one where it starts).</span>  It doesn't put the gray space at
the beginning and end, like it should.</p>

<H2>2. Padding on Inline Elements</H2>

<p class="testpadding">This is a normal testing paragraph, for reference.  It
is double spaced so that the padding looks reasonable when rendered
correctly.</p>

<p class="testpadding"><span>This paragraph is entirely an inline
element with padding.  The padding is 3em on the sides and 0.4em on
the top and bottom.  The side padding should create a green space at
the beginning and end of the text.  The top and bottom padding should
make the background of the inline element almost fill the gaps between
the lines.  Instead, MacIE ignores the top and bottom padding and uses
the side padding to increase the <em>margins</em> of the contaning
block-level element.</span></p>

<p class="testpadding">MacIE treats padding in the middle of the paragraph
just like it treats margins.  What should happen is just like what should
happen in the previous case:  the side padding creates additional
space with the background color of the inline element, and the top and bottom
padding make the background of the inline element expand into the spacing
between the lines.  <span>However, this is not what happens.  Instead,
the only thing MacIE does is indent both the beginning and end of any
line that is begun by the inline element with padding.</span>  This is not
the correct behavior, and causes very strange display for a reasonable
style suggestion.</p>

<p class="testpadding">
When the padding is large enough to extend outside of the half-leading
of the inline element (the leading is the difference between line-height
and font-size - half of it is placed on each side of the font), it should
<em>not</em> make the lines separate more.  Allowing it to do so
removes some of the power of CSS and misleads authors into thinking that
lines increase to allow for large padding.  MacIE not only increases the
line spacing, but it does <em>not</em> actually draw the padding that this
increase made room for.  The height of the lines should
<strong>not</strong> be affected by the <span class="yellow">yellow padding</span>
in any way.</P>
