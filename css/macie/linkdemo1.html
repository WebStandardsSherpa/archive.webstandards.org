  <TITLE>Web Standards Project: CSS: Bugs in MacIE:  Link Pseudo-classes (1)</TITLE>

<BODY><div id="outdatedwarning" style="background-color: white; color: black; text-align: center;"> <p>You&#8217;re viewing an archive of outdated material. Visit The Web Standards Project&#8217;s <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/"> updated site</a> to learn about our current mission.</p> </div>

<H1>Link Pseudo-classes (1)</H1>

<p>
	The <code>:link</code> and <code>:visited</code> pseudo-classes
	should be mutually exclusive.  An element can never match both at
	the same time.  MacIE incorrectly has <em>all</em> links match
	the <code>:link</code> pseudo-class, even if they also match
	the <code>:visited</code> pseudo-class.  This can mislead authors
	using MacIE to develop pages and lead to pages unusable on browsers
	that handle this distinction correctly.
</p>

<p>
	This page uses the following stylesheet:
</p>

<pre>
:link { color: blue; background: yellow; }
/* leave visited links as users default, however good an idea that may be */
</pre>

<p>
	Now we have what is hopefully a <a href="index.html">visited link</a>,
	which MacIE incorrectly gives the same background as <a
	href="http://www.nowhere.oz/no.file">unvisited links</a>.
	(However, its built in "UA stylesheet" rule for the foreground
	color still wins, which shows it is not truly acting as though
	the rules were given in a UA stylesheet.)
