<BODY><div id="outdatedwarning" style="background-color: white; color: black; text-align: center;"> <p>You&#8217;re viewing an archive of outdated material. Visit The Web Standards Project&#8217;s <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/"> updated site</a> to learn about our current mission.</p> </div>

<H1>Demonstration for <CODE>first-letter</CODE> and
<CODE>first-line</CODE></H1>

<H2>Example 1</H2>

<P>In the following paragraph, the first line should be green, the rest should be black.</P>

<DIV ID=demo1><P>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful golden cat
called Maximus. His one mission in life was to rest. He would wake up
in the morning, ready to sleep all the way through the day. Then he
would wake up at night, and have a nice lie in till the next morning.
He thought his life could never have been better, and indeed, it
couldn't. He lived happily ever after.</P></DIV>

<P>This is what it <em>should</em> have looked like (but possibly
wrapping in different places):

<DIV ID=demo1simulation><PRE><SPAN CLASS=firstline
>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful golden cat called Maximus.
</SPAN>His one mission in life was to rest. He would wake up in the
morning, ready to sleep all the way through the day. Then he would
wake up at night, and have a nice lie in till the next morning. He
thought his life could never have been better, and indeed, it
couldn't. He lived happily ever after.</PRE></DIV>

<H2>Example 2</H2>

<P>In the following paragraph, the first character should be three
times bigger than the rest.</P>

<DIV ID=demo2><P>Once upon a time, there was a slick black cat called
Charlie. His one mission in life was to eat. He would wake up in the
morning, and immediately look to see what he could feast on. He ate
chicken, and he ate mouse. He ate anything he could get his teeth
into. He thought his life could never have been better, and indeed, it
couldn't. He lived happily ever after.</P></DIV>
