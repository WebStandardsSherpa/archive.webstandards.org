<H1>Line-height Inheritance</H1>

<P>When <code>line-height</code> is set by percentage, MacIE does not
make the <em>calculated</em> value of the property inherit, rather it
makes the percentage value itself inherit. This causes lines to change
height when they should not.</P>

<H2>1. Line-Height at 130%</H2>

<P>The following paragraph contains two sizes of text. However,
because the <code>line-height</code> is set by using
<em>percentages</em>, <strong>the height of every line should be
exactly the same</strong>, that is, 13px.</P>

<PRE>
   .test       { font-size: 10px; line-height: 130%; }
   .bigwords {font-size: 300%; vertical-align: bottom; }
</PRE>
