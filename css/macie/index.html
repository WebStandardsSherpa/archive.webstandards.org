<DIV TITLE="Introduction">
 <H2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></H2>

 <P>
  Microsoft recently released Internet Explorer 4.5 for the
  Mac. This release makes significant improvements in many
  areas of CSS support.   In some areas (including some of the <A
  HREF="../winie/index-2.html#The_Top_5_Bugs">problems we described</a>)
  it is better than Internet Explorer 5.0 for Windows.
 </P>

 <P>
  On the Macintosh, it offers by far the best support for CSS1 in a
  publicly released browser. However, it still has significant
  problems. Its support for the visual formatting model is weak in
  some areas. Margins and widths are calculated incorrectly, and
  floating elements cause strange side effects. Styles applied to
  inline elements are interpreted incorrectly. It has serious problems
  in parsing the CSS language (and the seriousness of these last
  problems will only become fully apparent when they break new
  features added to the CSS).
 </P>

 <P>
  It also lacks important features of CSS1.  The <code>display</code>
  property is only partially supported, and a few others are not
  supported at all.   There is no user interface for the selection of
  alternate stylesheets, an interesting and useful feature of CSS1 and
  HTML 4.0.
 </P>

 <P>
  The implementations of <ACRONYM TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets,
  Level 1">CSS1</ACRONYM> in major Web browsers over the last three
  have been buggy and incomplete.   These implementations have caused
  great frustration and expense for Web authors, have won <ACRONYM
  TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</ACRONYM> an undeservedly obscure
  and difficult reputation, and have left many of its features unusable.
  <ACRONYM TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</ACRONYM> is more than
  just the small step above the <code>font</code> tag allowed by current
  browsers.  It is a powerful language that combines different suggestions
  for the presentation of semantic markup.
 </P>

 <P>
  Now that Netscape promises to release a comprehensive and thoroughly
  tested CSS1 implementation in the near future (which we will be
  examining in depth in due course), the WSP calls upon Microsoft to
  improve its implementation, letting Web designers, authors,
  application developers, and users build upon a single, robust
  foundation for Web presentation:
  <ACRONYM TITLE="Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1">CSS1</ACRONYM>.

 <DIV TITLE="Problems with float">
  <H3><a name="Float">1. Problems with <code>float</code></a></H3>

  <P>
   MacIE has some mysterious bugs related to the <code>float</code>
   property. Adjacent floated paragraphs may overwrite each other or
   text around them, floated elements may be placed in incorrect
   positions, and floated images may overlap surrounding text. In
   certain cases, text that is floated causes a line break in its
   container. This bug makes floats within text very difficult to use.
   Sometimes floating an image can even cause a link not to work.
   Taken as a whole, these bugs change floating from a safe and easy
   method for creating out-of-flow content to a risky and difficult
   one.

 <DIV TITLE="The block box model">
  <H3><a name="Block">2. The Block Level Box Model</a></H3>

   <P>MacIE does not follow the rules for for calculating margins and
   widths of elements described in <a
   href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1#horizontal-formatting">section
   4.1.2</a> of CSS1. Problems appear particularly when one or more of
   those values is set to <code>auto</code>. For example, when an
   element's width is set bigger than its containing block, it should
   be bigger than its containing block (and have a negative margin).
   MacIE incorrectly widens the containing block instead. That is, it
   incorrectly lets the contents of a block box affect its dimensions,
   something that should only happen when <code>height</code> is
   <code>auto</code>.
   </P>

   <P>MacIE also interprets the <code>margin</code> and
   <code>padding</code> shorthand properties incorrectly, applying
   them to the top and left only.
   </P>

   <P>Furthermore, MacIE does not support any of the box model properties
   on the <code>body</code> or <code>html</code> elements. This deficiency
   forces authors to create additional markup for the sole purpose of
   styling that markup.

 <DIV TITLE="The inline box model">
  <H3><a name="Inline">3. The Inline Level Box Model</a></H3>

   <P>The various <CODE>margin</CODE> and <CODE>padding</CODE> properties
   have serious problems on inline elements.  Side margin and padding
   should cause spaces at the beginning and end of an inline element.
   MacIE instead puts the indents at the beginning and end of every line
   but the first that the inline element occupies
   (and in both cases these indents act like margin, never padding).
   When the inline element begins a block box, the box properties of
   the inline element affect the containing block box.
   Top and bottom margin on inline elements correctly have no effect
   in MacIE.  However, top and bottom padding, which should extend the
   background of the inline element without changing the line-height,
   also have no effect, except to increase the line-height.</P>

   <P>Furthermore, the <code>vertical-align</code> and
   <code>line-height</code> properties are only partially implemented,
   which prevents complex text layout from being achieved, and the
   <code>border</code> property appears to be ignored on inline
   text.</P>

   <P>Rather than basing calculations of the vertical alignment of
   replaced elements on the size of the font of the parent element
   (where applicable) calculations are based on the size of the font
   of the tallest element in a line. While this is the correct basis
   for values of <CODE>top</CODE> and <CODE>bottom</CODE>, it yields
   incorrect results for the <CODE>vertical-align</CODE> values
   <CODE>baseline</CODE>, <CODE>middle</CODE>, <CODE>text-top</CODE>
   and <CODE>text-bottom</CODE>.</P>

   <P>MacIE does not let the computed value of the
   <code>line-height</code> property (when set by percentage) inherit.
   Instead, it makes the specified value given by the stylesheet
   author inherit. This is incorrect, as the specified value should
   only inherit when given as a dimensionless factor. It misleads
   authors by making them think that percentage and em units for line
   height are equivalent to the much safer dimensionless factors.</P>

 <DIV TITLE="Parsing and Error Handling">
  <H3><a name="Parsing">4. Parsing and Error Handling</a></H3>

   <P>MacIE's CSS parser has major faults in its error recovery
   code. The CSS1 specification explains very clearly how unrecognized
   CSS should be handled (i.e., what to ignore).  MacIE does not
   follow this part of the recommendation. Documents designed
   for future levels of the CSS specification will thus be displayed
   incorrectly, and sometimes bizzarely.</P>

   <P>Some of the problems include incorrectly interpreting escaped
   braces ("<code>\{</code>"), accepting unknown or missing units (and
   interpreting them as pixels), allowing quoted values, and treating
   two consecutive slashes in a selector (<code>//</code>) as a
   comment delimiter instead of as an unknown selector symbol.</P>

 <div title="Link Pseudo Classes">
  <h3><a name="Link">5. Link Pseudo Classes</a></h3>

  <p>
   MacIE has problems handling the pseudo-classes used for selecting
   links.  If multiple pseudo classes are given, it applies the style rule
   as if only the last pseudo-class given were present.  It should either
   ignore the rule completely (CSS1) or require that the elements match
   all the pseudo-classes (CSS2).  Furthermore, while <code>:link</code>
   and <code>:visited</code> should be mutually exclusive, it allows
   elements that match <code>:visited</code> to match <code>:link</code>
   as well.

 <DIV TITLE="display Property">
  <H3><a name="Display">1. <CODE>display</CODE></a></H3>

   <P>MacIE only supports one of the four values for the
   <CODE>display</CODE> property: <code>none</code>. This leaves
   <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code> and <code>list-item</code>
   unsupported.</P>

   <P><CODE>inline</CODE> is needed to allow a correct combination of
   logical markup and display. For example, an unordered list should
   by contained in a <CODE>UL</CODE> element, but the author may want
   that list displayed on one line. The display value of
   <CODE>inline</CODE> allows the correct combination of logical
   markup with style. The <code>block</code> value allows the opposite
   effect.</P>

   <P>This document has manually numbered <CODE>H3</CODE> elements. If
   the <CODE>list-item</CODE> display type were supported for
   <CODE>H3</CODE>, the UA might generate the numbering as with any
   other list, thus alleviating the burden on the document author to
   have to keep the numbering in check.</P>

   <P>CSS2 introduces a number of new values for the display property.
   While these values will also be useful, we believe
   designers would rather see them postponed in favor of complete
   support for the CSS1 values.</P>

 <DIV TITLE="Alternate stylesheet UI">

  <H3><a name="Alternate_stylesheet_UI">2. Alternate stylesheet UI</a></H3>

  <P>
   CSS1 allows authors to associate multiple stylesheets with a
   document, allowing users to choose the most appropriate or pleasing.
  </P>

  <P>
   For example, a designer could create a default "public" stylesheet for
   a body of documents, a second sheet suitable for intra-organizational
   or -departmental access to the same documents, and a third suitable
   for users who are visually impaired (using high-contrast colors,
   for instance). The mechanism is extensible to include transparent
   application of media-specific stylesheets: one for print, one for
   WebTV, another for hand-held device browsers - all without content
   redundancy. This document, for instance, written in HTML 4.0 Strict,
   is associated with three distinct stylesheets. Unfortunately, due to
   lack of support for this CSS1 feature, you are unlikely to have any
   choice but the default, or no stylesheet at all.  
  </P>

  <P>
   Among the primary design goals of CSS is to restore balance among
   the responsibilities the author, the user, and the user agent (UA;
   i.e., the browser) must share when negotiating the presentation of Web
   content under varying conditions.  These goals require the ability to
   specify a user stylesheet, the ability to disable author style sheets,
   the exposure of alternate author style sheets, the ability to change
   user stylesheets quickly, and the exposure of a UA default stylesheet
   for each media type.
  </P>

  <P>
   By not implementing a user interface for alternate
   and user CSS, MacIE turns CSS from a language designed to balance
   user and author needs into a fundamentally user-hostile instrument.
   With users unable to interact with CSS easily, authors are not only
   entertained with the promise of reckless authority in matters of style,
   but are also tempted to create documents that lack structural markup
   and are thus meaningless with any stylesheets other than their own.
