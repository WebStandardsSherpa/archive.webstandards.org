<h1>Problems with 'float' in Internet Explorer 4.5 for Macintosh</h1>

<p>The following examples of incorrectly
supported floating elements are taken from <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec414.htm">section
4.1.4</a> of the World Wide Web Consortium's <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">CSS1 Test Suite</a>. </p>

<P>IE 4.5 does not fail all of the tests on the W3C test page, in
particular it supports floating of images better than it does floating
of block elements.</P>

<div style="width: 640px; border: 1px solid red;">Note that your
window must be at least 640 pixels wide to see this problem! This DIV
should be 640 pixels wide - make sure that your window is wider than
this DIV to see the problems depicted below!</div>

<h2>1. Floating Paragraphs in a DIV</h2>

<h3>1.1 Left - Right</h3>

<DIV>
  <P class="left">This is a left-floating paragraph (first in source).</P>
  <P class="right">This is a right-floating paragraph (second in source).</P>
  MacIE incorrectly puts a space above the floating paragraph that
  occurs first.  (The margin is explicitly set to 0.)  The left floating
  paragraph should touch the top of the purple <code>div</code> just as
  the right floating one does.  The right floating
  paragraph should stay entirely within the top and side borders of
  the <code>div</code>, but it does not.  For some reason, it sticks out
  of the right side of the <code>div</code>.
</DIV>

<h3>1.2 Right - Left</h3>

<DIV>
  <P class="right">This is a right-floating paragraph (first in source).</P>
  <P class="left">This is a left-floating paragraph (second in source).</P>
  This example is similar to the previous one, except the right float
  comes first.  This shows that the extra space on top accompanies the
  first float, but the additional movement to the right occurs on
  right-floating paragraphs.
</DIV>

<h2>2. Floating elements inside fixed width DIVs</h2>

<h3>2.1 Paragraphs</h3>

<DIV style="width: 19em;">
  <P class="left">This is a left-floating paragraph (first in source).</P>
  <P class="right">This is a right-floating paragraph (second in source).</P>
  In this example, MacIE shows a very serious problem with floats.
  Floating should be a safe technique - when implemented correctly, floats
  can never overlap, and authors do not need to worry about overlap in
  unusual situations.  However, MacIE does not displace a right-floating
  element down when this displacement is needed to separate it from a
  left-floating element.  Instead, these elements overlap.  Furthermore,
  MacIE begins the text in the normal flow where there is no room for
  it, putting one word per line until the floats are complete.
</DIV>

<h3>2.2 Images</h3>

<DIV style="width: 400px;">
  <IMG SRC="images/hblank1.gif" class="left" width="250" height="30" alt="[This image should float to the left of the paragraph]"> 
  <IMG SRC="images/hblank2.gif" class="right" width="250" height="30" alt="[This image should float to the right of the paragraph]"> 
  This example demonstrates the same problem with overlap, except with
  images.  The images overlap in the same way the paragraphs do, and the
  text has the same problem flowing in the midst of the images.
</DIV>
