BROWSER STANDARDS TARGETED<BR>
by Carol Sliwa<BR> 

A group calling itself The Web Standards Project debuted  last week, with a charter to influence browser makers to do a better job  supporting standards. 
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Some 450 Web developers signed on within the first few  hours of the launch, according to founding member Glenn Davis, chief technology  officer at Project Cool, Inc., a Web-based publisher in Palo Alto, Calif. The  two major browser makers, Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.,  applauded the new group's efforts late last week but issued only "vague  mutterings, nothing solid yet" in terms of meeting the group's demands,  Davis said. 
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
"The problem is, with each generation of the browser, the  browser manufacturers diverge farther from standards support," Davis said.  
One of the group's chief complaints is weak support for the Cascading Style  Sheets 1 standard, which was designed to let Web developers attach colors and  fonts to World Wide Web pages and space text more easily. Neither Netscape's nor  Microsoft's 4.0 browsers fully support the standard, even though both shipped  after the World Wide Web Consortium finalized the standard in December 1996.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   
Both Netscape group product manager Eric Byunn and Microsoft product manager  David Wascha said Version 5 of their browsers will better support the standard.  Internet Explorer is in beta now; Netscape's 5.0 browser is due by year's end. 
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
The Web Standards Project also wants upcoming browsers to  support Document Object Model 1 and XML 1.0.

<DIV CLASS="cite"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>BROWSERS FAIL TO MAINTAIN STANDARDS</B><BR>
By KARLIN LILLINGTON

<BR>
    If you're one of those people who uses one browser at work and another
at home, you may have noticed something
odd sometimes the same Website will look completely different depending on
the browser.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

For example, if you have access to both a 4.0 or higher version of the two
main browsers, Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, have a look at Microsoft's own site
http:/www.microsoft.com. Odd, isn't it? Perhaps your
own company Website also comes in two forms.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Unless your site is very basic, with none of the dynamic add-ons that perk a
site up or make it more functional, you can
assume one of three things. First, that you have twin Websites, and which
one you see depends on what browser
you're using. Second, your (lazy) Website developers designed your site
using only the tools for one proprietary
browser Netscape's or Microsoft's and anyone looking at it with the "wrong"
browser is at best, losing some site
functionality, or worse, is looking at a jumbled mess.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

The third option, like the first, is another aggravation for Website
designers. Visitors to the site get the same
experience regardless of the browser, but that's because the Web designers
have had to do some fancy technical
footwork behind the scenes to get the proprietary technologies built into
one browser to also work with its rival.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

According to a new consortium of Web companies set up this week, at least 25
per cent of the cost of building
Websites for clients is tangled up in resolving the inherent
incompatibilities between the two leading browsers, wasting
millions of pounds each year.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

The pressure group, called the Web Standards Project
(http:/www.webstandards.org), came out swinging against
the two browser giants, complaining that they were adding enhancements to
their browsers which did not conform to
the standards they themselves supposedly supported and indeed, had helped
create. Those standards had been
approved by the World Wide Web Consortium (http:/www.w3c.org), the global
Web body that is recognised as a key
standards creator.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

In other words, the two companies are paying lip-service to the idea of
standards, and making sure they have a hand in
creating them, but then ignoring them with a cavalier disregard for the
people building the Web the developers and
designers, and those using it you.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

The compatibility problem is threatening to transform the Web, but only in
the most senseless and pig-headed ways.
Either businesses end up paying for the incompatibilities through increased
Website costs and
lowest-common-denominator Websites which avoid using conflicting
technologies, or we all lose out by being inexorably
steered towards using the same browser (and much if not most technical
innovation has come from healthy
competition, not monopoly).<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

One solution is to create non-proprietary standards. Those are standards
which offer technical specifications that
ensure products will interlock without compatibility issues and that content
(image, music, or text) can be broadcast and
delivered without conflicts. That's been the approach of an international
organisation called MPeg, the Moving Picture
Experts Group (see related story, page 7).<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

The other approach is that of W3C: allow companies to create technologies
which they can submit for approval as
standards. But that approach is farcical if the companies which create the
standards not only won't conform to those
put forth by their competitors but also ignore those they created
themselves.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

The Web may be a young medium but that is no excuse for browser companies to
act like spiteful children. Voice your
disapproval and add your name to the support list at the Web Standards
Project's Website.<BR>

<B>Browser  Inconsistencies Add 25 Percent To Cost Of Building Web Sites </B>

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resolving  incompatibilities among browsers adds at least 25 percent to the cost of  building Web sites, according to The Web Standards Project  (WSP), a newly-formed international coalition of leading Web developers  dedicated to promoting a worldwide standard for Web and browser design.  

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Calling on Microsoft, Netscape and others to live up to promises made in  July 1997, the WSP (http://www.webstandards.org) is urging browser makers to  fully support the standards created by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) in the  upcoming round of browser releases, as well as support emerging standards that  are being developed. Otherwise, contends the WSP, millions of dollars will  continue to be wasted each year on Web development. 
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

"The time for  proprietary innovation in Web browsers is past," says Glenn Davis, chief  technology officer of Project Cool Inc. "It's time for the browsers to  start fully supporting W3C core standards -- standards that Microsoft and  Netscape helped develop and promised to support." 
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Currently, beta  versions of both Netscape's Navigator 4.5 and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0  are adding more proprietary enhancements without providing complete support for  existing standards, WSP members say. Because the 5.0 browsers will likely become  a new baseline for desktop browsers due to theirsupport for XML, the WSP  believes resolving the current patchwork support for HTML, Cascading Style  Sheets, Document Object Model and ECMAScript is crucial. 
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
"Because  Web developers have to build multiple versions or perform time-consuming  workarounds to accommodate visitors on different browsers, most shy away from  using proprietary features because of the extra costs involved," says  George Olsen, design director and Web architect at 2-Lane Media in Los Angeles.  "While clients may want to see these features, few of them are willing to  pay for having the site built more than once." 

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to  increasing the cost of Web sites, the lack of common standards is breeding a  sense of frustration among developers. "Most of my design ideas are really  simple, but executing them consistently across Internet Explorer 3 & 4, as  well as Navigator 3 & 4 is anything but," says Jeffrey Zeldman, a New  York Web publisher/designer. "I have to engage in laborious workarounds,  simply to end up with a very basic design that works." 

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This lack of  consistent support for sophisticated presentation standards, such as Cascading  Style Sheets, has its long-term effects as well, according to the WSP.  Developers will focus on simpler solutions rather than concentrate on longevity.  

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In the absence of standards for thesegreat technologies, we tend  to create disposable content dismissively instead of sticking to a solid  foundation for the long-term," says Martin Diekhoff, web applications  developer for the Getty InformationInstitute. 

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adds Todd Fahrner, design  technologist for Studio Verso in San Francisco, "Browser makers should try  to take the long view, and realize that surviving the 'browser war' won't matter  much if the Web itself breaks apart. Supporting the standards might sound like  an altruistic goal in a competitive market, but developers and their clients are  losing patience with compromised support for baseline standards like CSS1."  

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The current problem will only be further complicatedwith the rise  of television-based and PDA-based Web browsers," warnsAnn Navarro, owner of  WebGeek Communications, and treasurer for the HTML Writers Guild. Navarro says  the WSP is also urging browser makers to participate in and support the efforts  of the W3C's recently formed Mobile Access group, which will be developing  standards for PDA and cell phone-based Web browsers.</DIV> &nbsp;

<DIV CLASS="cite"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AGAINST CLIENT PROBLEMS <BR>
HTML code does not look the same in Internet Explorer as in Netscape.
Against the fact that the leading webclients are partially incompatible,
WSP (Web Standards Project) are now protesting. The differences between the
webclients are not huge, but large enough to cost web producers money. The
ones who wants to offer crowd-pleasing effects is forced to spend time and
work on testing their code in several different environments. The extra
cost is said to be 25 percent of the total price of a website. The newly
founded WSP is now demanding that Microsoft and Netscape live up to earlier
promises of fully supporting the standards that W3C (Worldwide Web
Consortium) stand behind in upcoming versions of their software. Otherwise
large amounts will be spent unnecessarily.<BR>

                              development cheaper and faster. Because the leading
                              browsers behave differently, developers must often
                              build several different versions of a site so that every
                              visitor can use it. ''Web development costs are 25
                              percent greater than necessary because of all the
                              different work-arounds we've got to build for
                              different browsers,'' said Glenn Davis, a Web
                              developer and member of the coalition.

Our first international mention, from <A HREF="http://stadt.notes.online.no/bedrift98.nsf/web/b50428637*1162127108" target="_blank">digi.no/bedrift,</A> three days prior to official launch. Now if we could only translate it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://goliath.ifrc.mcw.edu/news/wsp.html" target="_blank">Informatics Research Center</A> came out in support of WaSP today, saying:</P>
<DIV CLASS="cite">
The development of true cross-browser standards would allow the Informatics Research Center to develop web applications which could confidently be deployed on all browsers.  Cross-browser standards would allow every developer to utilize the latest technology with out having to create a plethora of different versions for all of the various browsers available today, thus minimizing development time and costs.</DIV> <BR>

More international coverage, from the land of Ingmar Bergman: <A HREF="http://www.pagina.se/" target="_blank">Pagina Online</A> ran a feature in which they said:</P>
<DIV CLASS="cite">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>PROTESTER MOT SKILLNADER MELLAN WEBBL&Auml;SARE</B><BR>
En grupp webbdesigners har grundat en f&ouml;rening f&ouml;r att protestera mot
skillnader mellan webbl&auml;sarna fr&aring;n Netscape och Microsoft. Skillnaderna g&ouml;r
att, f&ouml;r att nyttja m&ouml;jligheterna fullt ut s&aring; kr&auml;vs tv&aring; olika upps&auml;ttningar av
en webbplats, vilket f&ouml;rdyrar ca 25%. Sammanslutningen vill f&ouml;rm&aring; dessa b&aring;da
konkurrenter att enas f&ouml;r en standard. Det finns &auml;ven en supportlista som man

<DIV CLASS="cite">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>Translation:</B><BR>
A group of web designers have founded an association to protest against the differences between the web browsers from Netscape and Microsoft. The differences require two different versions of a website, which makes  projects 25% more expensive. The group will try to make these challenging companies agree to one standard. There is also a support list that you can sign.
