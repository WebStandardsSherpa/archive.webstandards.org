<H2>AN OPEN LETTER TO MICROSOFT: <BR>IT'S TIME TO GET IT RIGHT</H2>

<P class="buzz">
Love them, loathe them, or anything in-between, Microsoft is a fact of life, and Microsoft's browser has at least half the market. Now that Netscape has committed to delivering full support for Cascading Style Sheets Level-1, HTML 4.0, DOM 1.0 and XML 1.0 in Navigator 5 &#150; and appears to be on the verge of doing so &#150;  it's time to get Microsoft to commit to doing the same.

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

If they do this, <A HREF="index-2.html">The Web Standards Project</A> will have largely fulfilled its mission to bring these standards to our medium.

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Unfortunately, Microsoft sounds noncommittal these days when we discuss the concept of "full support" within a reasonable time frame. While Microsoft itself has argued eloquently for common standards when it comes to instant messaging, they don't seem to be showing the same passion when it comes to browsers. It's two steps forward, one step back.

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

We don't want to take that one step back. We need your help to convince Microsoft that working developers are serious about full compliance with key Web standards. Specifically, we need to act now so that Microsoft will take the issue seriously EARLY in the development cycle for the next release of Internet Explorer. We'd rather raise our voices now (and get results) than complain later.

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

We've written a letter (right) outlining our position. The more of you who send it to Microsoft, the bigger the dent we can make in their reticence to commit to full standards compliance, and the likelier we are to have fully standards-compliant browsers in this lifetime.

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Please join us by signing your name to the letter below, and sending it to
<A HREF="mailto:standardsnow%40webstandards.org">standardsnow<img src="images/at-600-white-10x10.gif" width="10" height="10" alt="at">webstandards.org</A>. We'll take it from there.

<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Thank you!</p>

<P>
As a member of the Web Standards Project and a working developer building
Web sites, I am writing to ask that Microsoft take the next logical step in
its support for W3C standards, and deliver full (100%) support for
Cascading Style Sheets Level-1, HTML 4.0, DOM 1.0 and XML 1.0 in the next
version of Internet Explorer.
</P>

<P>
Full support of these standards will enable developers and designers to
finally embrace this technology, which Microsoft helped create, and which
Microsoft was the first to begin supporting. Less than full support in
Internet Explorer would be a bad marketing decision when its largest
competitor delivers the goods.</P>

<P>
(Microsoft's support for these standards has been far superior to
Netscape's, but that will change when Netscape releases Navigator 5.0,
which WILL offer 100% support for these standards, according to independent
reports.)</P>

<P>
For the good of your browser and the advancement of the Web as a great
medium for communications, commerce, and art, I urge you to go the distance
and make full support for these standards a priority for your Internet
Explorer development team. If you cannot commit to that time frame, I'd
like to know when when Microsoft DOES plan to deliver full support for
these standards. (If the answer is "never," I'd like to know that, too, so
I can let my clients and site visitors know that standards-compliant sites
may not work properly on Internet Explorer.)</P>

<P>
Sincerely,</P>

<P>
(YOUR NAME),<BR>
